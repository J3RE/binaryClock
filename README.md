# binaryClock

There are a lot of ESP8266 clocks and weather stations with small I2C OLED/LC Displays out there. But I wanted to build something a bit more unique. So I started building this binary clock. I laser cut some acrylic and wood plates. Then I designed the electronic schematic, soldered the components on a prototyping board and screwed all parts together. After some days of coding and debugging the clock finally works.
